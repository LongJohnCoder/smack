# Installing, running and using the tool
## Prerequisites
### Vagrant
You can determine if Vagrant is already installed by typing
`$ vagrant`
in a shell.

If Vagrant is not installed, then installation instructions can be found at https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/.

This will allow you to use our included Vagrant file to automate the building and installation of the tool in a virtual machine.
### git
If git is not currently installed, follow the instructions at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
